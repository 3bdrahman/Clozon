# Front-End: 
### I used react components for their re-usability to populate page content.

### Navigation: 
#### I used react router to handle in-website navigation. The feature of having all components loaded as if it's a one-page website impressive. The website loads different pages at once.

# Back-End:

### Firebase Authentication: 
#### I was able to let users create user accounts and login / logout.

### Firestore database: 
#### Used for storing account details such as order history and current cart items.

### Stripe API: 
#### Used to process payements and confirm transactions.

### Note: The order-history isn't loading and the payement doesn't say processed because Firebase needs me to upgrade my plan to use cloud-functions.
